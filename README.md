# Medical-RAG-Assistant-Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-for-Clinical-Decision-Support
A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for healthcare professionals, leveraging trusted medical manuals (e.g., Merck Manual) to deliver accurate, context-grounded answers to clinical questions. 

Project Introduction

Purpose:

Provide healthcare professionals with rapid, reliable, and up-to-date medical knowledge using a RAG pipeline grounded in authoritative sources.

Key Features:

Answers clinical questions on diagnosis, treatment, and protocols

Uses trusted medical manuals as the knowledge base

Reduces information overload and standardizes care

Supports real-time, context-aware recommendations

2. Architecture Overview
RAG Pipeline:

Document chunking and embedding (e.g., using SentenceTransformers)

Vector database (e.g., ChromaDB) for semantic search

LLM (e.g., Mistral, LLaMA) for answer generation

Evaluation modules for groundedness and relevance

Tech Stack:

Python, LangChain, ChromaDB, SentenceTransformers, Llama/Mistral LLMs

Optional: FastAPI or PySide6 for interface

3. Setup and Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/medical-rag-assistant.git
cd medical-rag-assistant
Install dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Prepare data:
Place your medical manual PDF(s) in the data/ directory.

Run data ingestion and embedding:

bash
python scripts/data_ingestion.py
Start the application:

bash
python app.py
4. Usage
Ask clinical questions via the provided interface (CLI, GUI, or API).

Sample queries:

"What is the protocol for managing sepsis in a critical care unit?"

"What are the common symptoms for appendicitis?"

5. Project Structure
Folder/File	Description
data/	Medical manuals and source documents
scripts/	Data ingestion, chunking, and embedding scripts
src/	Core application code (retriever, LLM, etc.)
requirements.txt	Python dependencies

6. Evaluation
Automated evaluation of answer groundedness and relevance using built-in scripts.

Metrics:

Groundedness (1–5): Are answers supported by retrieved context?

Relevance (1–5): Does the answer directly address the question?

7. Contributing
Pull requests are welcome.
